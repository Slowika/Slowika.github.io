<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Daniel Kahneman - Thinking, Fast and Slow</span></i>

<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Margaret Atwood - The Testaments</span></i>

<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Stephen King - On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</span></i>

<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson - The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life</span></i> 

This was a captivating and approachable book. The authors use the framework of mixed-motive games to explain human social behaviours. I was sold on the explanation of "strategic ignorance" and "strategic self-deception" at the personal and at the institutional level. The book discusses modern personal relations, consumption, advertising (e.g. lifestyle advertising), art, charity, education, medicine, religion - and so given the range of topics, it probably introduces some oversimplification. I would like more discussion on how to build environments that incentivise people to do "the right thing".

Amy sets a good example of how to appreciate friends and co-workers, and how to be insanely passionate and successful at work while keeping the ego at bay. I suppose reading this book was more uplifting than listening to Slaughterhouse-Five narrated by James Franco in winter in Canada. Interestingly enough, both books feature time travel. The book by Amy also contains major Parks and Recreation spoilers.

So it goes.
