<span style="color:green"> **Reading is one of my greatest pleasures in life. It is a form of meditation and an exercise in attention. Being able to focus on one thing for an extended period of time is sadly a degrading skill and attention is our scarcest resource. Even though reading might seem passive, it is also an active experience of connecting the content with my existing knowledge and thoughts. This year I started keeping track of the books I read and I am trying to summarize the way each book resonates with me. I am happy to receive book recommendations. Apart from machine learning research and development I am interested in (among others) biographies, human language and communication, game theory in "real life", trustworthy and approachable sources on health and psychology.**</span>

<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Malcolm Gladwell - Outliers: The Story of Success</span></i>

<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Stephen King - On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</span></i>

Table of contents:
1. A short and captivating autobiography
2. Tongue-in-cheek advice on how to write (and "how to do a freelance/creative job")
3. A gruesome accident

<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson - The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life</span></i> 

This was a captivating and approachable book. The authors use the framework of mixed-motive games to explain human social behaviours. I was sold on the explanation of "strategic ignorance" and "strategic self-deception" at the personal and at the institutional level. The book discusses modern personal relations, consumption, advertising (e.g. lifestyle advertising), art, charity, education, medicine, religion - and so given the range of topics, it probably introduces some oversimplification. I would like to read more about how to build environments that incentivise people to do "the right thing".

Amy sets a good example of how to appreciate friends and co-workers, and how to be insanely passionate and successful at work while keeping the ego at bay. I suppose reading this book was more uplifting than listening to Slaughterhouse-Five narrated by James Franco in winter in Canada. Interestingly enough, both books feature time travel. The book by Amy also contains major Parks and Recreation spoilers.

So it goes.
