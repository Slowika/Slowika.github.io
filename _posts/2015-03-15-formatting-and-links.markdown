<span style="color:green"> **Reading is one of my greatest pleasures in life. It is a form of meditation and an exercise in attention. Being able to focus on one thing for an extended period of time is sadly a degrading skill and attention is our scarcest resource. Even though reading might seem passive, it is also an active experience of connecting the content with my existing knowledge and thoughts. This year I started keeping track of the books I read and I am trying to summarise the way each book resonates with me. I am happy to receive book recommendations. Apart from machine learning research and development I am interested in (among others) biographies, human language and communication, game theory in "real life", trustworthy and approachable sources on health and psychology.**</span>

<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Przemysław Chojecki - Jak być dwudziestolatkiem</span></i>

I read it in a day. I like the crisp sentences and the light style - the book is not grounded in the Polish exuberant writing style and it would read very well in the English version. It is a collection of honest, personal thoughts (at no point did I feel a "curated self-image!" alert) of a relatable and likeable guy, with personal values of freedom, constant learning and curiosity. I like that it highlights the idea that people who have experienced a lot (for example, in terms of the number of degrees and professions they have, and the countries they lived in) are not superhumans and rather those who find it worth it to stress more for the sake of curiosity, impact and exploration. 

<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Malcolm Gladwell - Outliers: The Story of Success</span></i>

I like that the title suggests a collection of impressive biographies (or a recipe for success) and the actual book talks about the random and external factors behind a "success". Discussing non-individual factors behind professional achievements in a way that does not undermine the hard work is tricky. Reading this book supports inner peace: it is very humbling and I love the fact that it discourages from gatekeeping and making quick judgements about others. People working in academia and machine learning researchers, as it were, tend to be slightly more on the individualistic and competitive side. I have no idea how to build a more human, less superficial and less competitive society, but it is already a lot to strengthen and cultivate such values in one's own head. I was a bit uncomfortable with the last chapters on cultural background and "why Asians are good at math", these stories and hypotheses could have been presented in a more inclusive way: hearing the actual voices of people with such heritage would have been more interesting. 

<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Stephen King - On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</span></i>

Table of contents:
1. A short and captivating autobiography
2. Tongue-in-cheek advice on how to write (and "how to do a freelance/creative job")
3. A gruesome accident

<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson - The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life</span></i> 

This was a captivating and approachable book. The authors use the framework of mixed-motive games to explain human social behaviours. I was sold on the explanation of "strategic ignorance" and "strategic self-deception" at the personal and at the institutional level. The book discusses modern personal relations, consumption, advertising (e.g. lifestyle advertising), art, charity, education, medicine, religion - and so given the range of topics, it probably introduces some oversimplification. I would like to read more about how to build environments that incentivise people to do "the right thing".

<i><span style="background-color: #efe5de">Amy Poehler - Yes Please</span></i>

Amy sets a good example of how to appreciate friends and co-workers, and how to be insanely passionate and successful at work while keeping the ego at bay. I suppose reading this book was more uplifting than listening to Slaughterhouse-Five narrated by James Franco in winter in Canada. Interestingly enough, both books feature time travel. The book by Amy also contains major Parks and Recreation spoilers.

So it goes.
