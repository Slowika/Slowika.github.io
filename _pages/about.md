Hi, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Agnieszka (either /aɡˈɲɛʂ.ka/ or Aga works). 

I am a second-year PhD student within the [Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/ai/) at the University of Cambridge and a (long-term) research intern at [Mila](https://mila.quebec). I am affiliated with [Lucy Cavendish College](https://www.lucy-cav.cam.ac.uk). My PhD supervisors are [Sean Holden](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sbh11/) and [Mateja Jamnik](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201/). At Mila I am supervised by [William L. Hamilton](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/), [Anirudh Goyal](https://anirudh9119.github.io) and [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org).

**Broadly, I am interested in systematic generalisation and compositionality. In my PhD, I am investigating these problems in the domains of emergent communication and visual reasoning.** 

I do my best to contribute to the departmental activities as well as to the broad machine learning community (most recently, as a reviewer for [ICML 2020](https://icml.cc), [EMNLP 2020](https://2020.emnlp.org/) and [NeurIPS 2020](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/)). I also have a great passion for teaching and I currently teach and supervise undergraduate students at the [AI4GoodLab 2020](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/). For more academic activites, please refer to [Varia](https://slowika.github.io/varia/).

I hold an MSc with Distinction in Operational Research with Data Science from the University of Edinburgh. In my [MSc thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gvxaaxrqvkjr2np/thesis.pdf?dl=0) I proposed a new approach to relational reasoning with convolutional neural networks. I also hold a BSc degree in Computer Science from the Jagiellonian University. In my BSc thesis I investigated probability distributions defining random projections in extreme learning machines under supervision of [Wojciech Czarnecki](http://wojciechczarnecki.com).

In the meantime, I had an opportunity to intern in data science and software engineering at IBM, Architech and Barclays UK.

I'm a traveller at heart: I visited 35 countries and lived in five so far. On that note, I had a chance to learn four foreign languages, which allows me to throw awkward sentences in attempts at icebreaking to this day. I also love mountains and [Andrej Ivašković](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ai294/).
