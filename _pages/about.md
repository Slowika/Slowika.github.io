Hi, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Agnieszka (either /aɡˈɲɛʂ.ka/ or Aga works). 

I am a second-year PhD student within the [Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/ai/) at the University of Cambridge and a (long-term) research intern at [Mila](https://mila.quebec). My PhD supervisors are [Sean Holden](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sbh11/) and [Mateja Jamnik](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201/). At Mila I am supervised by [William L. Hamilton](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/), [Anirudh Goyal](https://anirudh9119.github.io) and [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org).

Broadly, I am interested in reasoning, systematic generalisation and compositionality. I am currently investigating these problems in the domain of reinforcement learning in games. 

I am affiliated with [Lucy Cavendish College](https://www.lucy-cav.cam.ac.uk). Starting from November 2019, I serve as the representative of the AI research group at the [Graduate Students' Forum](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/local/phd/gradforum). 

I hold an MSc with Distinction in Operational Research with Data Science from the University of Edinburgh. In my [MSc thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gvxaaxrqvkjr2np/thesis.pdf?dl=0) I proposed a new approach to relational reasoning with convolutional neural networks. I also hold a BSc degree in Computer Science from the Jagiellonian University. In my BSc thesis I investigated probability distributions defining random projections in extreme learning machines under supervision of [Wojciech Czarnecki](http://wojciechczarnecki.com).

In the meantime, I had an opportunity to intern in data science and software engineering at IBM, Architech and Barclays UK.

I'm a traveller at heart: visited 35 countries and lived in five so far. On that note, I had a chance to learn four foreign languages, which allows me to throw awkward sentences in attempts at icebreaking to this day. I like reading and will try to [keep track of the books I recently enjoyed](https://www.instagram.com/reading_challenge/). I also love mountains and [Andrej Ivašković](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ai294/).
