Hello, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Agnieszka (Aga) and I am a first-year PhD student within the [Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/ai/) at the University of Cambridge, jointly-supervised by [Sean Holden](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sbh11/) and [Mateja Jamnik](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201/).

**Until February 2020 I am interning at Mila AI Institute of Quebec under supervision of [William L. Hamilton](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/). I work on compositional generalisation in multi-agent systems.**

I received my MSc at the University of Edinburgh where I worked with the [BayesWatch group](https://www.bayeswatch.com) on relational reasoning with neural networks. I also hold a BSc degree in Computer Science from the Jagiellonian University. In my final year I was investigating extreme learning machines under supervision of [Wojciech Czarnecki](http://wojciechczarnecki.com) as a part of [GMUM](http://gmum.net).
