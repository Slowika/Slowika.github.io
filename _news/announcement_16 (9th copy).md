I gave two contributed talks at the NeurIPS workshops: 1) **Algorithmic Bias and Data Bias: Understanding the Relation between Distributionally Robust Optimization and Data Curation** at [NeurIPS workshop on Algorithmic Fairness through the Lens of Causality and Robustness (AFCR 2021)](https://www.afciworkshop.org/) and 2) **On the Relation between Distributionally Robust Optimization and Data Curation** at [NeurIPS Workshop on Optimization for Machine Learning (OPT 2021)](https://opt-ml.org/).
