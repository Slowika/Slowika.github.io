The [project](https://github.com/Slowika/AI_Ethics) I supervised as a TA at [AI4Good Summer Lab](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/) was presented at the Demo Day and it won in the final competition as the best Academic project. The students were awarded an additional stipend of $1000 and additional mentoring from academia. Congrats!
