I joined [AI4Good Summer Lab](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/) as a Teaching Assistant! I taught modules on Linear Algebra, Introduction to Probability, Calculus, Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning to undergraduate students in STEM. I also supervised a project on [AI Ethics](https://github.com/Slowika/AI_Ethics).
