In February and early March, I'm mentoring PhD students and post-docs from the University of Cambridge as part of the [Data for Science Residency Programme](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/schmidt-data-science-residency-programme). We discuss their datasets and applications of machine learning to scientific discovery (e.g., building tools for automation of literature review, optimising data analysis in neuroscience and chemistry, long-term prediction in materials science, anomaly detection in cloud microservices).
