I attended [The Theoretical Foundations of Machine Learning Conference](https://tfml.gmum.net/) and presented our work on [Relational reasoning with Dilated DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00410). This was later presented at [The 6th Annual Oxbridge Women in Computer Science Conference](https://oxbridgewomenincs.splashthat.com/) in the poster session.
