I gave a [short talk](https://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/160885) with an overview of my last ~year of research on learning from multiple data distributions. The extended version is going to be presented at the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences [(IMPAN RL Seminar)](https://www.impan.pl/en/activities/seminars/reinforcement-learning) on the 28th of June!
