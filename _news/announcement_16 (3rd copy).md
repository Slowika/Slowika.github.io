In the next months, I'm going to teach **Maths for Data Science (Advanced)** to professionals via [Cambridge Spark](https://cambridgespark.com/ai-apprenticeships-l7-academy/) (full-day online workshops). On a related note, I will also supervise undergraduate courses in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2021/ArtInt/) and [Introduction to Probability](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2021/IntroProb/) at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/).
